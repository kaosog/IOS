Makes use of Fincial Modeling Prep API to scan for top moving stocks and then retrieves data to display past 50 day chart using Swift charts

Will then display the past 50 days except the most recent 10 days, from there the app will ask the user if they believe the stock will go up or down from there
If they guess the movement correct they will get a point!
